## Abstract
This research paper introduces a robot created to assist in search and rescue missions, particularly in disaster-stricken areas following events such as earthquakes, floods, or conflicts. Conventional search methods often fall short or pose risks when trying to locate survivors trapped under collapsed structures. This robot, powered by AI, tackles this challenge by blending control with a compact agile design. Its small stature enables it to maneuver through spaces and gaps amid the debris where survivors are typically located. With a camera and sophisticated AI algorithms onboard, the robot can identify signs of life like movement, heat signals, or even faint noises. This leads to an enhancement in the effectiveness and safety of search and rescue efforts compared to excavation or depending solely on visual scans. The upcoming sections of this report will delve into the robot's design and development process, delving into its capabilities and the specific AI methods utilized. We will discuss the impact of this technology in saving lives during disasters and promoting rescue missions for first responders.

## 3. Conclusion
This paper highlights the substantial progress made in disaster response technology through the creation 
of an exploratory robot that utilizes artificial intelligence. This robot presents a viable option for quickly 
detecting and assisting survivors stuck in disaster zones by integrating a compact design with advanced AI 
algorithms like YOLO-V8. The incorporation of technology such as Raspberry Pi, SIM808 module, and 
motor with encoder improves its capability in navigation, communication, and obstacle avoidance . After 
conducting tests and evaluations it is evident that the AI system, YOLO V8 shows impressive performance 
in accurately identifying various objects, including people even in challenging scenarios, like partial 
obstruction. These advanced capabilities significantly enhance the efficiency of the search robot in locating 
survivors and potential dangers. Moreover the practicality and success of the prototype are evidenced in 
its real world application as it navigates obstacles effectively and transmits information about identified 
items or individuals. The integration of features such as webcams ultrasonic sensors and communication 
modules enables interaction and data exchange with rescue teams or monitoring centers.
In essence the study suggests that the search robot holds promise for revolutionizing search and rescue 
operations during emergencies. The swift and accurate functions of this technology in finding survivors 
while minimizing risks to rescuers underscore its potential to save lives and mitigate disaster impacts. With 
technology continually advancing, enhancements and adaptations to search robots like this one will 
undoubtedly play a role in enhancing the efficacy and efficiency of disaster response efforts, in the future.
